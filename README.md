# Console-Finances-C4

## Description

This repository serves to showcase my work in completing the Module 4 Challenge of my edX Bootcamp.

The challenge was a real-world situation, tasking me with writing JavaScript code to analyse the financial records of a company. 

The starter code for this challenge provided me with a financial dataset composed of arrays with two fields, Date and Profit/Losses. I was required to write JavaScript code capable of analysing the financial records to calculate each of the following:

- The total number of months included in the dataset.

- The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.

- The average of the changes in Profit/Losses over the entire period.
- Track the total change in Profit/Losses from month to month and then find the average.
- (Total/(Number of months - 1))

- The greatest increase in Profit/Losses (date and difference in the amounts) over the entire period.

- The greatest decrease in Profit/Losses (date and difference in the amounts) over the entire period.

My final code was to print the anlaysis to the console, as per the following Demo:

## Usage

To view my work on this challenge, you can review the sections of this repository, and my delpoyed site which is at https://aireytf.github.io/Console-Finances-C4/ 

To review the calculations resulting from my JavaScript code, on the deployed site referenced above, open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. There you can navigate to the console header and view the calculations. 

As my JavaScript code analyses the financial records using only one function and a single block, it was not necessary to use 'let' in place of 'var' declarations as block-scoping was not needed. If my code required nested blocks, I would have utilised 'let' declarations as best practice in that situation. 

## Credits

I researched the elements needed to analayse these financial records using JavaScript code, utlising such resources as w3schools.com, mdn web docs, and stackoverflow.com
